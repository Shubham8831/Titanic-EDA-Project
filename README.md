# 🚢 Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis

Welcome to the Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This repository provides an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset, revealing insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival.

## 📂 Project Overview

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python. We delve into the data to understand survival patterns and trends based on various factors such as age, gender, and passenger class.

## 📊 Key Features

- **🔄 Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **📈 Visualization:** Stunning visualizations created with Seaborn and Matplotlib to highlight important relationships within the data.
- **📉 Statistical Analysis:** Deriving meaningful insights through statistical methods.
- **🛠️ Libraries Used:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

## 🚀 Getting Started
